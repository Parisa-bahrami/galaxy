const e={title:"Mars",description:`
      Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish surface. Mars has two large moons named Phobos and Deimos. This planet is considered one of the most important targets for research in the solar system due to its many similarities to Earth.
    `,formationTitle:"How was Mars formed?",formationDescription:`
      Mars initially formed as a rocky and cold body near the Sun. Over time, rocky and metallic materials combined to form Mars' core. Then, the mantle and outer crust were formed.
    `,featuresTitle:"Features of Mars",featuresDescription:`
     Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is known as the "Red Planet" due to its reddish surface. It has two small, irregular moons named Phobos and Deimos, which are likely captured asteroids. Phobos, the larger of the two, orbits Mars every 7 hours and 39 minutes and rises and sets three times in a Martian day. Deimos is smaller and appears more like a star from the surface of Mars. Solar eclipses on Mars are not total due to the small size of its moons.
    `,appearanceTitle:"Appearance of Mars",appearanceDescription:`
     Mars appears red from space, indicating its iron oxide-rich surface. The planet's surface is covered with impact craters and tall mountains. The reddish color of Mars is due to iron-rich minerals in its regolith. Regolith is a layer of loose rocks and dust covering the planet's surface. According to NASA, the oxidation of iron minerals gives Mars its reddish appearance.
    `,atmosphereTitle:"Atmosphere of Mars",atmosphereDescription:`
      Mars' atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and argon. This atmosphere is very thin, and its pressure is much lower than Earth's atmosphere.
    `,moonsTitle:"Moons of Mars",moonsDescription:`
Mars has 2 moons
Phobos and Deimos are two small, irregular moons of Mars, likely captured asteroids.
    `,conclusionTitle:"Physical characteristics of Mars and Earth",conclusionDescription:`
Mars is less dense than Earth, with a volume of 15% and a mass of 11% that of Earth. Its surface area is slightly less than the total land area of Earth. Mars is larger and denser than Mercury, resulting in stronger surface gravity. In terms of volume and mass, Mars is the eighth-largest object in the solar system. Its size, mass, and surface gravity are intermediate between Earth and the Moon: Earth's Moon is half the size of Mars, Earth is twice the size of Mars, and Earth's mass is ten times that of Mars.
