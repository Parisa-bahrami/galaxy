const e={title:"Jupiter",description:`
      Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth planet from the Sun. This planet has a strong gravitational force due to its massive size and has  95 moons. Jupiter is known as one of the most active planets in the solar system due to its high-pressure atmosphere and large storms.
    `,formationTitle:"How was Jupiter formed?",formationDescription:`
      Jupiter initially formed as a cold, gaseous body near the Sun. Over time, gaseous and rocky materials combined to form Jupiter's core. Then, lighter gases condensed around the core, forming the planet Jupiter.

    `,appearanceTitle:"Appearance of Jupiter",appearanceDescription:`
Jupiter's most prominent feature is the Great Red Spot, a massive anticyclonic storm larger than Earth, observed since at least the 19th century. Located at 22 degrees south latitude, it is easily visible with amateur telescopes. The storm rotates counterclockwise with a period of 6 days and reaches up to 8 kilometers above Jupiter's clouds. While mathematical models suggest the storm is stable, its size has been steadily decreasing. In the late 1800s, the spot was about 56,327 kilometers wide (four times Earth's diameter), but by 2017, it had shrunk to 16,350 kilometers (1.3 times Earth's diameter). Jupiter's vast atmosphere and rapid rotation allow for more stable storms compared to Earth.
  `,atmosphereTitle:"Atmosphere of Jupiter",atmosphereDescription:`
      Jupiter's atmosphere is composed of hydrogen and helium. The planet has large storms known as the Great Red Spot.
    `,ringsTitle:"Rings of Jupiter",ringsDescription:`

Jupiter's rings are very faint and thin, making them difficult to observe. They are primarily composed of fine dust and rock particles, likely formed by meteoroid collisions with Jupiter's small moons. Jupiter's rings consist of three main components: the halo ring, the main ring, and the gossamer ring. These rings were first discovered in 1979 by the Voyager 1 spacecraft and have been studied ever since.
    `,moonsTitle:"Moons of Jupiter",moonsDescription:`
      Jupiter has 95 moons, some of which are very large. Famous moons of Jupiter include Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.
Jupiter has the most moons in the solar system. Its four largest moons (Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa) are known as the Galilean moons. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system.
      `,conclusionTitle:"Comparison of the mass and density of Jupiter",conclusionDescription:`
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times the combined mass of all other planets in the solar system. The barycenter of Jupiter and the Sun lies at a distance of 1.068 times the Sun's radius from the Sun's center. Jupiter's volume is 1,321 times that of Earth, but its mass is only 318.5 times Earth's, indicating a lower density compared to Earth. Jupiter's radius is about one-tenth of the Sun's, and its mass is 0.001 times the Sun's, making their densities similar.
