    title: "Neptune",
    description: `
      Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the solar system. This planet is known as one of the most active planets in the solar system due to its high-pressure atmosphere and large storms. Neptune has 16 moons, some of which are very large.

    formationTitle: "How was Neptune formed?",
    formationDescription: `
      Neptune initially formed as a cold, gaseous body near the Sun. Over time, gaseous and rocky materials combined to form Neptune's core. Then, lighter gases condensed around the core, forming the planet Neptune.

    featuresTitle: "Features of Neptune",
    featuresDescription: `
      Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in the solar system. This planet is known as one of the most active planets in the solar system due to its high-pressure atmosphere and large storms.
    Neptune, the fourth-largest planet in the solar system, is primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane, with no solid surface but a solid core. Along with Uranus, Neptune is classified as an ice giant due to its higher concentration of icy molecules compared to gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Deeper within the planet, heavier elements like methane, ammonia, water, and rocky/metallic materials dominate. Neptune has a radius of 24,622 kilometers, a day lasting 16 Earth hours, and a year spanning 165 Earth years. Occasionally, Neptune is farther from the Sun than Pluto, but their highly elliptical orbits ensure they never collide.

    appearanceTitle: "Appearance of Neptune",
    appearanceDescription: `
Neptune appears blue from space, indicating its high-pressure atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium. The planet's surface clouds shine in a bright blue color, partly due to the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere. These clouds are primarily composed of icy methane particles, which are the main cause of Neptune's blue hue.

    atmosphereDescription: `
      Neptune's atmosphere is composed of hydrogen, helium, and a small amount of methane. This atmosphere has large storms known as the Great Dark Spot.

Triton is Neptune's largest moon and is unique for its retrograde orbit (opposite to Neptune's rotation). Triton is likely a captured Kuiper Belt object.
