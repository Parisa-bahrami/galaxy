    description: `
      Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known as the "Blue Planet" due to its cold and blue atmosphere. This planet has 28 moons and is known as one of the most active planets in the solar system due to its unusual rotation.

    formationTitle: "How was Uranus formed?",
    formationDescription: `
      Uranus initially formed as a cold, gaseous body near the Sun. Over time, gaseous and rocky materials combined to form Uranus' core. Then, lighter gases condensed around the core, forming the planet Uranus.

      Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known as the "Blue Planet" due to its cold and blue atmosphere. This planet has 28 moons and is known as one of the most active planets in the solar system due to its unusual rotation.
    Uranus is tilted on its side, with its rotational axis inclined about 98 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit. Some scientists believe this tilt resulted from a collision with a massive object, possibly the size of a rocky planet, in the distant past. Due to this tilt, Uranus has the longest seasons among the planets, with each season lasting about 21 Earth years. Its orbital period around the Sun is 84 Earth years.

    ringsTitle: "Rings of Uranus",
    ringsDescription: `
      Uranus has a small and dark set of rings. These rings are composed of particles of rock and ice.
   Uranus has two sets of rings: narrow, dark gray inner rings and two outer rings, one reddish and the other blue. A total of 13 rings have been discovered around Uranus, named in order of distance from the planet as Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by dust belts. Images from the James Webb Space Telescope clearly show the rings' brightness. According to a 2016 study, the rings of Uranus, Saturn, and Neptune are likely remnants of dwarf planets, similar to Pluto, that were captured and torn apart by the gravity of these giant planets.
