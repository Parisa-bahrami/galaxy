    description: `
      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the solar system. This heavily cratered and small planet has no moons and orbits the Sun faster than any other body. Mercury has the highest density in the solar system after Earth, with a massive metallic core diameter ranging from 3,600 to 3,800 kilometers, or 75% of the planet's total diameter. In contrast, the outer crust of Mercury is only 500 to 600 meters thick. The heavy core and composition of this planet, which contains a very high amount of volatile elements, have become a puzzling mystery for scientists.

    formationTitle: "How was Mercury formed?",
    formationDescription: `
      About 4.6 billion years ago, the solar system was a cloud of gas and dust called the solar nebula. Gravity caused the materials to collapse and rotate rapidly. Thus, the Sun formed at the center of this nebula. With the formation of the Sun, the remaining materials condensed. Smaller particles, due to gravitational forces, stuck together and formed larger particles. Solar winds pushed lighter particles away, leaving only rocky and heavy materials near the Sun, which formed rocky planets like Mercury. Like Earth, Mercury's metallic core initially formed, and then lighter elements formed its mantle and crust. Based on observations of extraterrestrial planets, the core accretion theory can be considered the dominant theory of the formation of rocky planets.

    featuresTitle: "Features of Mercury",
    featuresDescription: `
      One Mercury year is equal to 88 Earth days, and one Mercury day is 59 Earth days. This planet has a slow rotation around its axis but has the highest orbital speed around the Sun. The surface of Mercury resembles the surface of Earth's Moon due to asteroid bombardment in the early formation of the solar system, making it full of impact craters.
    Mercury has no moons due to its proximity to the Sun and the Sun's strong gravitational pull.

    appearanceTitle: "Appearance of Mercury",
    appearanceDescription: `
      Much of Mercury's surface appears grayish-brown. Additionally, bright streaks called "crater rays" are visible on the surface of this planet. These streaks formed during asteroid or comet impacts on Mercury's surface.
