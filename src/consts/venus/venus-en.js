    formationTitle: "How was Venus formed?",
    formationDescription: `
      Venus initially formed as a rocky and hot body near the Sun. Over time, rocky and metallic materials combined to form Venus' core. Then, the mantle and outer crust were formed.
    The internal structure of Venus is likely similar to that of Earth. Like Earth, Venus is a rocky planet composed of rock and metal, and it probably has a molten metallic core, a rocky mantle, and a crust. Since Venus is slightly smaller than Earth, the pressure in its depths is 24% lower than the pressure in Earth's interior. The main difference between the two planets is the absence of tectonic plates on Venus's surface. This could be due to the higher strength of Venus's crust.
