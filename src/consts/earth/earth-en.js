  description: `
      Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. This planet has one moon and a rich atmosphere that provides suitable conditions for life. Earth has a heavy metallic core, a rocky mantle, and an outer crust.

  formationTitle: "How was Earth formed?",
  formationDescription: `
      Earth initially formed as a rocky and hot body near the Sun. Over time, rocky and metallic materials combined to form Earth's heavy metallic core. Then, the mantle and outer crust were formed.
   Earth is composed of three main layers: the core, mantle, and crust. The core is about 7,100 kilometers wide and consists of a liquid outer core (approximately 2,250 kilometers thick) and a solid inner core (about 2,600 kilometers in diameter). The core generates Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from harmful solar particles. The mantle, about 2,900 kilometers thick, is semi-solid and viscous, and the movement of materials within it drives phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain formation. Earth's crust is divided into two types: continental (average thickness of 40 kilometers) and oceanic (about 8 kilometers thick). The continental crust is primarily made of granite, while the oceanic crust is composed of basalt. As we move toward the core, the temperature increases. The outer core's temperature ranges between 3,700 to 4,300 degrees Celsius, and the inner core can reach a scorching 7,000 degrees Celsius, even hotter than the Sun's surface.

  atmosphereTitle: "Atmosphere of Earth",
  atmosphereDescription: `
      Earth's atmosphere is highly stable chemically and consists of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. These components provide suitable conditions for life.
    Earth's atmosphere is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of water vapor, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. No other planet in the solar system has an atmosphere rich in free oxygen, an element essential for life. The atmosphere becomes thinner with altitude, and its effects can be detected up to 600 kilometers above Earth's surface. The lowest layer, the troposphere, is constantly in motion, creating various weather conditions. The next layer, the stratosphere, contains the ozone layer, which blocks harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Greenhouse gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide trap the Sun's heat, keeping Earth warm. Without this greenhouse effect, Earth would be too cold for life, but an excess of these gases could lead to extreme conditions like those on Venus.

  conclusionTitle: "The future of Earth",
  conclusionDescription: `
      Earth is known as a unique planet in the solar system that provides suitable conditions for life.
Humanity is currently grappling with global climate change, which has led to stronger storms, longer droughts, and larger natural disasters. Over its 4.5-billion-year history, Earth has experienced many climatic shifts, but human activities have accelerated these changes by intensifying the greenhouse effect. These transformations threaten ecosystems worldwide and endanger the survival of many species, including humans. Scientists predict that in 250 million years, Earth will become too hot for land mammals to survive. In addition to climate change, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and asteroid impacts pose significant threats to life. However, despite past mass extinctions, life has always persisted. In the distant future, the depletion of atmospheric oxygen and the death of the Sun as a red giant will ultimately eradicate all life.
